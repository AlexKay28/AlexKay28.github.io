  <h1><b>METAPHYSIC(V) TERMS</b></h1>
  <p>
    One of the major works of Aristotle and in the history of philosophy is "Metaphysics". This is a compilation and contains 14 books.
    Each of them might be read independently from each other and discussed separately. I find all of them interesting, but in
    the fifth book (V) Aristotle introduces main terms that describe the substance of knowledge. All
    of them with definitions are collected here.

  <h2><b>Definitions</b></h2>

  <h4>Beginning</h4>
  - part of a thing from which one may begins; ex: a line or a journey has one beginning here, and another one at the opposite side.
  <h4>Cause</h4>
  - the material/substance from which thing exists, comes into being; ex: the wood is the material of a table.
  <h4>Element</h4>
  - the indivisible into categories and anything else unit which is the base of a thing; ex: the sound is the element of our speech, but words are
  not the elements of the text, because the word itself is already the text.
  <h4>Nature / "Physis" </h4>
  - the genesis of growing things, that immanent thing from which a growing thing begins to grow.
  <h4>Necessary</h4>
  - that without which life is impossible; ex: respiration and food are necessary for animals.
  <h4>One</h4>
  - something single in a accidental or in a absolute sence.
  <h4>Being</h4>
  - accidental being, absolute being.
  <h4>To be & Is</h4>
  - mean that something is TRUE, and in case of NOT to be that something is FALSE.
  <h4>Substance</h4>
  - simple bodies that can represent something in groups, but can be divided into groups themselves.
  <h4>The same</h4>
  - accidentally the same; ex: "white" and "cultured" are the same because they are accidents of the same subject, and the "man" is the same as
  "cultured" because one is the accident of the other.
  <h4>Opposite</h4>
  - is applied to contradiction, contraries, relative terms, privation, state, extremes; generation != destruction.
  <h4>Contrary</h4>
  - attributes, generically different and which can't be applied at the same time to the same thing.
  <h4>Prior & Posterior</h4>
  - in one sense something is nearer (absolutely or naturally) to the starting point than the other (might be applied to the TIME). Prior - something that
  happens before the target process, but posterior - something that happens after the target process.
  <h4>Potency / "Dynamis"</h4>
  - the source of motion or change which is in something other than the thing changed. ex: the sunlight for the flower in the morning.
  <h4>Impotence</h4>
  - the potency privation, abolition of the potency. ex: midnight light power is not enough for the flower to start opening.
  <h4>Quantity</h4>
  - something that is divisible into parts. Group of units. ex: puzzles, the heap of stones.
  <h4>Quality</h4>
  - the category difference, differentia of the essence. The man is an animal of a certain quality.
  <h4>Relative</h4>
  - something that is relative to others in a countable manner (countable even in terms of space of real numbers). ex: two is relative to four as 0.5.
  <h4>Perfect or Complete </h4>
  - outside of which it is impossible to find even a single one of its parts. Doctor or musician is complete == they are absolute
  professionals and can be more skilled than they already are.
  <h4>Limit</h4>
  - part of each thing and the first point outside of which no part of a thing can be found. ex: the maximum possible number of push up you can do.
  <h4>That in virtue of which</h4>
  - the form of the essence of each individual thing or immediate substrate in which thing is naturally produced.
  <h4>Disposition</h4>
  - arrangement of that which has parts.
  <h4>Having</h4>
  - in essence of activity, the action or moving what someone has right now;
  in an essence of disposition, in virtue of which the thing which is disposed of is disposed well or badly.
  <h4>Affection</h4>
  - quality in virtue of which alteration is possible.
  <h4>Privation</h4>
  - thing does not possess an attribute that is a natural possession.
  <h4>To have or possess</h4>
  - direct in accordance with one's own nature or impulse; receptive material, something is present.
  <h4>To be from something</h4>
  - to come from something in respect of either of the primary genius or the ultimate species.
  <h4>Part</h4>
  - something which is taken from quantity.
  <h4>Whole</h4>
  - something which is not lacking parts of which it is called a natural whole.
  <h4>Multilated</h4>
  - something which has no part of itself and it cant be called a natural whole.
  <h4>Genus / Race</h4>
  - continuous generation of things of the same type; anything from which things derive their being as the prime mover of them into being.
  <h4>False</h4>
  - something that is not or cannot be substantiated.
  <h4>Accident</h4>
  - that which applies to something and is truly stated, but neither necessarily nor usually.
